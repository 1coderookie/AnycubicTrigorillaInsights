R65 is labeled as \"000\", which means it has zero resistance and is basically just a 'bridge' to close the circuit there. So you can either unsolder it and then solder it to R66, or you carefull chip R65 away and close the contact at R66 with a small piece of wire you solder across them (or solder only). The following picture shows the location of R65 and R66.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Make sure to not harm any other parts and don't create any short circuits! </p> <p>The second option is to use a special fork of Klipper: \"catboat\". Catboat addresses and solves the issue on a software side, so you don't have to solder. You can find <code>printer.cfg</code> files for all the printer models where this mainboard was being used here - please make sure to use the correct one.  </p>"},{"location":"type_pro/#pro-b-v102","title":"Pro B V1.0.2","text":"<p>It is a 32bit 24V mainboard with a Huada HC32F460 KCTA ARM Cortex-M4 with 192KB SRAM and 512KB Flash.
